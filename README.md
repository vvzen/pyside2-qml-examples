# pyside2-qml-examples

There are very few examples online of **QML** using **PySide2** as a backend, so I decided to start collecting some simple ones while I learn this technology.
I think QML is a great idea that clearly separates logic from presentation, so hopefully people in VFX and Animation will start using it (instead of handling all of the .ui to .py autogenerated code madness).

I've read online about QML from people in VFX and there is a certain sentiment that it's only for creating fancy "mobile-like" experiences.
In my humble opinion, they aren't getting the big picture.

### Addenda
#### Why I think QML can be good idea..

1. I don't like looking at your 1000 lines of autogerated UI code just to get a feeling of the underneath data model

2. It makes it easier to make edits on the presentation layer without touching the python code

3. We can create components that define a certain behaviour and reuse them (buttons but even lists, menu bars, etc..)

4. Yes, It's still a little bit of a PITA to use QML inside Nuke/Maya/Houdini, but things are slowly changing.
In the meantime, nothing prevents you from doing standalone apps in QML, as long as you've got ways to properly package/source PySide2 (rez, conda, pip, tcl-modules, etc..)

5. If you're crazy enough and you realize in the mid of a project that you need more performance, you could potentially rewrite the backend in C++ and leave the frontend almost untouched.

6. It finally offers TreeViews and TreeModels!

#### ..and why it's still challenging

1. You need to learn something new (pros for some, con for others)

2. There's not really a lot of huge amount of docs for Python

3. You might find it harder to tweak some of the UI elements exactly as you'd like to

4. It's still not a mature framework (but he's a bright kid)

# list-view
Very simple example showing an example of how to populate a 1d list-view using a model.

# 2d-list-view
Slightly more complex example showing how to implement a basic app that uses threads and signals to perform a long blocking calculation without blocking the UI.
Also shows an example of a 2d list view where each row item contains sub items.

# publisher-app
Boiler-plate code that shows how you could integrate drag & drop and some parsing logic in order to fill a list view.
This could be for example used an app for publishing frames
